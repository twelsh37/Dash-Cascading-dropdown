# Dash-Cascading-dropdown
Dash Cascading dropdown example - 
This was built out of looking at - Dash App With Chained Callbacks [https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks]  

My problem was I had 3 dependant dropdown list boxes
Level1, Level2 and level 3

Level 3 contents depended on Level 2, 
Level 2 depended on Level 1
Level 1 had 3 choices and that was all I had to start with.

Hopoefully someone may find this useful.

I am just learning dash so at least I have it now.

This was created and tested with Python 3.8.3
